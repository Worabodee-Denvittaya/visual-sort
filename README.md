Welcome to Visual Sort! I am fascinated by algorithms and often times I want to see them visualised. So I created this app which visualises Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort. It is also a way for me to learn and experiment with React, and I really enjoyed building it! I might come back and refine the code later.
